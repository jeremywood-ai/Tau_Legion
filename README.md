## Q&A for the Course
**With several courses on Machine Learning and AI, how is this unique?**
Here are the top reasons:
1. Cloud-based machine learning keeps you focused on the current best practices.
2. In this course, you will learn the most useful algorithms. Don’t waste your time sifting through mountains of techniques that are in the wild
4. Cloud-based service is straightforward to integrate with your application and has support for a wide variety of programming languages.
5. Whether you have small data or big data, the elastic nature of the AWS cloud allows you to handle them all.
6. There is also *no* upfront cost or commitment – Pay only for what you need and use  

### Tau Legion's Development Goals
1. Focused learning algorithm with a trained model into Amazon Web Services' SageMaker.
1. Built-in scale on-demand
1. Data management with use of a Data Lake solution
1. Clean Interface for application using *API Gateway* and *Lambda*
1. Amazon tools integration to secure, catalog, tranform datasets into visualization

### My Expectations
1. Foundation understanding of SageMaker
1. Create a robust machine
1. Smartly incorporate Amazon tools into Tau Legion's ecosystem

### Instructor
[instructor]: My name is Chandra Lingam, and I am the instructor for this course.  I have over 50,000 thousand students and spend considerable amount of time keeping myself up-to-date and teach cloud technologies from the basics.
