## Amazon SageMaker, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning with Python Course

This project's course focuses on:
1. Cloud-based machine learning style.
1. Learning the most useful algorithms, reducing wasting time diving through oceans of information and techniques
1. Cloud-based service allows for integration applications and support for a wide variety of programming languages.
1. Whether using small data or big data, the elastic nature of the AWS cloud allows for efficient managements and resources.
1. Lastly, no upfront cost or commitment â€“ *pay only for what I need and use*  

### Hands-on Labs  

In this course, I will work through hands-on labs to develop solutions to some challenging problems.

What does this project offer me?
Here are a few things this course has:

### AWS SageMaker
* How to deploy a Notebook instance on the AWS Cloud
* Understanding into algorithms provided by SageMaker service
* Learn how to train, optimize and deploy the models

### AI Services
In the *AI Services* section,
* Learn about a set of pre-trained services that can directly integrate with  applications
* Within a few minutes, build image and video analysis applications, similiar to face recognition. *I have built an OpenCV, SSD, and MTCNN for facial recognition, prior to Tau_Legion*
* Develop solutions for natural language processing, like finding sentiment, text translation, and conversational chatbots. *Additionally, I have developed an Seq2Seq Chabot.*

### Integration 
* Learning algorithms is one part of the story - Understand know how to integrate the trained models in the application
* Learn how to host models, scale on-demand, handle failures
* Provide a clean interface for the applications using *Lambda* and *API Gateway*

### Data Lake 
* Data management is one of the most complex and time-consuming activities when working on machine learning projects.
* With AWS, a variety of powerful tools for ingesting, cataloging, transforming, securing, visualization of your data assets.

* To collect the aforementioned data, thhe project will have a **data lake** solution in this course.

### Machine Learning Certification
* This project is on my path to becoming **AWS Machine Learning Specialty Certified**.

### Source Code
* The source code for this project available on Git that ensures latest code availablity

### Developer
My name is [Jeremy Wood](https://jeremywood.ai), and I am excited about developing this project through the instruction of Chandra Lingam. I have completed more than 10 machine learning models. This will be my first developed solely in the cloud environment.

### Instructor
My name is Chandra Lingam, and I am the instructor for this course.  I have over 50,000 thousand students and spend considerable amount of time keeping myself up-to-date and teach cloud technologies from the basics.

I have the following AWS Certifications: Solutions Architect, Developer, SysOps, Solutions Architect Professional, Machine Learning Specialty.  I am looking forward to meeting you.
